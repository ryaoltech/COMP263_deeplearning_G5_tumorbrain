Project Overview
This project is structured into three main parts, each focusing on different aspects of image processing and machine learning for brain tumor analysis.

### Part 1: Tumor Prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
CNN Basic: Basic CNN models for tumor prediction.
CNN with Augmentation: CNN models enhanced with image augmentation techniques to improve accuracy.
CNN with Autoencoder: Utilization of CNNs with an autoencoder for feature extraction and improved prediction accuracy.

### Part 2: Brain Image Generation
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): Employing GANs for synthetic brain image generation.
Framework: PyTorch is used to implement and train GAN models.

### Part 3: Advanced Image Processing with Various Frameworks
ResNet: Implementation of Residual Networks for efficient image processing.
EfficientNet: Using EfficientNet models for high efficiency and accuracy.
VGG19 and RESNET50: Implementations using VGG19 and a modified version of ResNet with 50 layers.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored within the brain_tumor_dataset directory.

Execution Instructions

Environment: All code was developed and is intended to be run using Google Colab.
Setup: Upload the code files to Google Colab for execution.
Data Management: It is recommended to upload the test data to Google Drive for easy access and management in Google Colab notebooks.
Library Dependencies: Ensure the availability of necessary libraries including imutils and torch.

Once the notebooks and the dataset are uploaded to Google Colab, you can execute any of the provided notebooks to run the models or analyze the data.
